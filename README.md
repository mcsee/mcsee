# Dont's:

- Not keen on Specific Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Low Level Languages at all. Those days are over. We are in the 2020s, not the 70s. So I keep myself away from C, C++, C#, and specially Golang.
- Not suitable for: Premature Optimization, Gold Plating, Code Hacking and Ninja Coding.
- Not the Fireman guy. I like robust and evolutionary quality software.
- I'm not very strong on Low Level Business Logic. There are much better candidates at it.
- Front End Languages, Visual Styling decisions and everything related to UIs should be made by more suited people than myself.
- Been a CTO for some years. Now I prefer working in depth with a stack (any) instead or dealing with lots of different technologies.
